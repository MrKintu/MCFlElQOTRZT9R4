# Genetic Algorithm for Simulating Genetic Mutations

## Overview
This project implements a genetic algorithm to simulate genetic mutations and evolution in a population. The algorithm explores how traits can evolve over generations through selection, mutation, and crossover.

## Objectives
- To define a population of chromosomes and simulate genetic mutations.
- To visualize the evolution of traits over generations.
- To analyse the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in solving optimization problems.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
